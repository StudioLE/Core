## About

Abstract interfaces to declare when a class implements a conventional design pattern.

Following conventional design patterns ensures code is clear, readable and easy to maintain. By using these interfaces, developers can quickly identify when a class implements a design pattern. As well as providing basic inheritable `xml-doc` which link to [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and other valuable resources with additional documentation about the pattern.
